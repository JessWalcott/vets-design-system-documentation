# Error messages

## System messaging

Alerts the user of important system-related issues or status. It’s initiated by the system and it’s not a result of the user’s actions.

***Note:** See [Error Messages](/patterns/error-messages#next-step-calls-to-action) for guidance on when to consider adding instruction to call the VA.gov help desk or other "next-step" call to action.*

## Engagement messaging

Nudges the user to enter or update data in the system. It can be initiated by either the system or another user.

***Note:** See [Error Messages](/patterns/error-messages#next-step-calls-to-action) for guidance on when to consider adding instruction to call the VA.gov help desk or other "next-step" call to action.*

## Access messaging

Appears when the user tries to access an item that’s not available to them. It may be because the record has been deleted, the user doesn’t have access, etc.

***Note:** See [Error Messages](/patterns/error-messages#next-step-calls-to-action) for guidance on when to consider adding instruction to call the VA.gov help desk or other "next-step" call to action.*

### System downtime

Variations in messaging will be contingent on:

- Whether or not the downtime is scheduled/expected
- If scheduled, when the application will be back up (precise time stamp if known, general estimate if not)
- If not expected, general estimate of when the application will be back up
